# RAG-Application
Simple RAG Application using all open source models.
\n
Hello everyone! In this project, I utilized the Langchain framework and Huggingface to develop a simple RAG application. This app is easy to use. To get started, install the required packages listed in the requirements.txt file and then run main.py. I employed Mistral LLM and all-mpnet-base-v2 -> This is a sentence-transformers model: It maps sentences & paragraphs to a 768 dimensional 
 dense vector space and can be used for tasks like clustering or semantic search, while ChromaDB was used for vector storage.
